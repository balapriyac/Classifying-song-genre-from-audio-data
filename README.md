# Classifying song genre from audio data

 This is a project from Datacamp.
 Using a dataset comprising of songs of two music genres (Hip-Hop and Rock),
 the task is to train a classifier to distinguish between the two genres based only on track information derived from Echonest (now part of Spotify);
 Making use of pandas and seaborn packages in Python for subsetting the data, aggregating information, and creating plots during EDA.
 To classify a song's genre based on features such as danceability, energy, acousticness, tempo, etc.,implementations of common algorithms such as PCA, logistic regression, decision trees are used.
